  "body": "Find your ideal (champion) match! Using champion mastery data our dating service finds champions that are a perfect match for you, whether you're interested in something quick (getting a chest) or something more long term (finding a new main).\r\n\r\nSummoners enter their region and name and the service pulls their champion mastery data. They initially see their list of champions and the service recommends hooking up (getting a chest) with champions they have a high grade with (or high number of mastery points with) but haven't gotten lucky (earned a chest) with yet. \r\n\r\nThen their data is anonymized and aggregated against all summoner data to provide even better recommendations. Our service finds based on champions you have received a chest-worthy grade with, which other champions other summoners have received a chest-worthy grade with using simple relational data aggregation. A more advanced service using machine learning finds what type of playstyle you have based on your champion mastery level with various champions, and recommends champions that fit your playstyle that you haven't mastered yet. Finally, aggregated data is used to find the \"biggest playas\" (summoners with the most total mastery points) and \"top power couples\" (summoners with most mastery points for a specific champion).",
